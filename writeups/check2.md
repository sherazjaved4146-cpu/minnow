This lab took me about [n] hours to do. I [did/did not] attend the lab session.

Describe Wrap32 and TCPReceiver structure and design. [Describe data
structures and approach taken. Describe alternative designs considered
or tested.  Describe benefits and weaknesses of your design compared
with alternatives -- perhaps in terms of simplicity/complexity, risk
of bugs, asymptotic performance, empirical performance, required
implementation time and difficulty, and other factors. Include any
measurements if applicable.
//for wrap around:
1)i made a one liner code which converts 64-bits to 32 bits and used type_casting{static_cast<uint32_t>(n)//when value is 2^32-1 -> 0}{benifits ->0(1) complexity 0(1) space complexity and simple}
